          <p>As one of Indiaâ€™s foremost home-grown automotive brands, we are delighted to have reached this significant milestone for our passenger vehicles segment. We
          are honoured to have the legendary Mr. Anupam Kher as the narrator of the glorious journey of a brand that is a legend in itself. This film is a testament to not
          only our evolutionary growth over the last 30 years but also the growth that India has seen as a nation through this period. This narration celebrates Tata
          Motors and all those who have supported us in these years, as we continue to provide class-defining products to our consumers, thereby allowing us to be
          thought leaders in the realm of design, safety and performance..</p>
